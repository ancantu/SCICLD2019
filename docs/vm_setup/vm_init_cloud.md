4. Enter your XSEDE credentials. <br>(Use the `train###` information we handed out in class).<br>Best results will occur if you treat your username as if it were case-sensitive when using Jetstream. <br>

<!-- 5. After you type in your XSEDE username and password:
 * confirm whether you will allow your credentials to be used to access Jetstream.
 * You may wish to review the terms of service and privacy policies linked on that page.
 * Generally, this screen will only be displayed when there are changes to `Globus Auth`.  To use Jetstream, click `Allow`.
