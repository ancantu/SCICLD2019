### Using Terminal Software to SSH Into Your Instance
Unlike `WebShell`, terminal software needs two additional pieces of information:

 1. The IP Address of your instance: <br> <img src="../../resources/IP_address.png" width="800" height="380"><br>

 2. The SSH Keys of the machine from which you're connecting

##### Setup SSH Keys
SSH public keys must be added to your Atmosphere settings:
1. To add your ssh key(s) to Jetstream, click on your `<username>` in the upper right hand corner and then click `Settings`.

2.  On the `Settings` screen, under `Advanced`, click `Show More`, to expand the section for adding your SSH key.  Click the blue/green plus sign to actually add your key.

3. On the next screen give the key a descriptive name (e.g. Smith_laptop) and then paste the contents of your PUBLIC ssh key into the dialog box.

 * In Linux and MacOS you can find your originating Public SSH key via:<br>
 ```
 cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 ```

4. After you have pasted in your SSH key, click `Confirm`.  You will then be back at the Settings screen with your key shown in the SSH Configuration section.

5. **You must redeploy or reboot** an instance **WHENEVER** adding or updating your SSH public-keys in order to have those keys added to the instance.


#### Terminal Software:
#### MacOS X & Unix/Linux Terminal
* **Mac OS X**: open a terminal window (from Finder, go to Applications, click Utilities, and then double-click Terminal) or type ⌘-space to get Spotlight and type `terminal` and select `Terminal.app`.
* **Linux**: there are many terminal options, including xterm, konsole, or gnome-terminal.
* In the terminal window, enter the following command, using your XSEDE username and the instance IP address:
```
ssh <your_xsede_username>@<instance_ip_address>
```

Press `<Enter>`.
A successful login will look similar to the following:

#### Windows Terminal using PuTTY
PuTTY is an SSH client for Windows.  It operates a bit differently than Terminal to make the initial SSH connection. For a useful guide to using PuTTY, see [PuTTY – Remote Terminal and SSH Connectivity](https://support.suso.com/supki/SSH_Tutorial_for_Windows).

1. Download the PuTTY application.
2. Launch PuTTY.
3. The first time PuTTY is used for login, add your private key.
  * Single click the "Default Settings" session to save your private key for all future sessions.
  * Click on the `+` symbol next to the `SSH` category on the left hand side.
  * Click on the `Auth` category to bring up the PuTTY Configuration screen (see screenshot below).
  * The key is set down at the bottom under `Private key file for authentication`. Click on the Browse button next to the `Private key file for authentication` field and locate your private key file on the file system. Select the file and press `Ok`. (It is probably in your My Documents folder. )
  * Click the `Session` category from the left hand side.
  * Make sure `Default Settings` is still selected.
  * Click Save.

Enter the IP address, either copied from your My Instances list or from the confirmation email, and click Connect.
Enter your XSEDE username when prompted for a login name and click Enter.
