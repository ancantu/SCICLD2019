## Launch (Deploy) an Instance
---

1. Jetstream virtual machines (VMs) are organized by projects.
 * To access projects, click on <img src="../../resources/atmo-projects-button.png" height="30"> from any screen.
 * To create a new project, click <img src="../../resources/atmo-create-proj-button.png" height="30">.
 * Fill out the name and description. <br><img src="../../resources/atmo-create-project.png" width="40%">.<br> Best practice is to name a project something concise and informative so that, along with the description, one can quickly identify instance roles.

2. Jetstream VMs may be started clicking `New> Instance`. <br> <img src="../../resources/atmo-new-item.png" width="30%">.
 * This shows a catalog of `Images`: _Instances whose configurations have been saved as template from which to launch identical Instances_.
 * On the page listing of images, scroll through the list or enter an image name, tag or description in the search box.<br>For instance, to locate images named or tagged with “Docker”, enter that text in the search bar.<br>The search is not case sensitive.<br>  
  <img src="../../resources/atmo-image-select.png" width="50%">.
  * `Featured` (system maintained) and `Public` images are shown. `Featured` images are recommended as these have been tested by Jetstream staff.


3.  Selecting an image will show the `Launch an Instance / Basic Options` screen:
<img src="../../resources/atmo-instance-launch.png" width="80%">

    * Enter a **name** for the instance
    * Select the image **version** if there are multiple versions available
    * Select or change the **project** to hold this instance.
    * Indicate the **allocation** source. <br>Allocations govern how much compute resources are available. These can be change on the fly.
    * Choose the **provider** to run on, Indiana or TACC.<br>Currently Jetstream has two partially independent clouds.<br>Some resources, like storage **Volumes**, are accessible only **within** the same provider.
    * Choose the **instance size**. <br>This indicates the vCPUs, memory, and disk size for the VM. See the [Virtual Machine Sizes table](https://wiki.jetstream-cloud.org/Virtual+Machine+Sizes+and+Configurations) to show the available options and the SUs consumed per hour.<br><img src="../../resources/atmo-VM-size.png" width="60%">
    * Check projected resource usage: **Allocation Used** and **Resources Instance will Use**.
    * Click `Launch Instance` to start the initialization and build of the instance.


4. When the instance is finished building and deploying, you'll see the label changes to *Status* "<font style="color:Green;">● </font> **Active**" and shows the IP Address: <br> <img src="https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/17465484/active.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1457464079048&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=808&height=188">

5. Click on the Instance name to see the characteristics of the Instance as well a various [management actions](https://wiki.jetstream-cloud.org/Instance+management+actions) that can be taken.
 + **Image**: create a new Image from this Instance)
 + **Suspend**: put the Instance to "sleep"
 + **Shelve**: shutdown and store the Instance
 + **Stop**: shutdown the Instance but do not store
 + **Reboot**: restart the instance
 + **Redeploy**: renew the cloud and IP status of the instance
 + **DELETE**: remove the Instance
 + **Open Web Shell**: Open a terminal window (command line) to the Instance
 + **Open Web Desktop**: Open a VNC Desktop to the Instances

 Note: avoid `Old WebShell` or `Old WebDesktop` as these are deprecated and going away soon.
