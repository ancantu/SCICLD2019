## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an orchestration tool that allows management of containers across multiple nodes. This demo uses only 1 node, but you could have 10s-1000s.

Kubernetes might be more developer-centric than some of the other technologies we've looked at. The idea is to run your code without having to know anything about the underlying system its running on.

## Overview

* Pod: Smallest deployable unit. Consists of 1 or more containers. Kind of like "localhost".
* Deployment: Multiple pods.
* Service: Expose a pod or deployment to network.
* Volume: Attach storage.
* Namespace: Permissions-based grouping of objects.
* Job: Run a container to completion.

And more not covered today:

* ConfigMap: Store strings or files for pods to use.
* Secret: Cncrypted configmap.
* Ingress: Expose HTTP+S routes to the network. Like a HTTP-specific Service.
* DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, LoadBalancer, etc.: More ways to do things. 


## Kube install check

Once ansible has finished ( [Ansible](ansible.md) ), you can check that everything is up:

    kubectl get all --all-namespaces

Should look something like this (node everything in "Running" status):
    
    NAMESPACE     NAME                                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

Check out how many nodes we have registered:

    kubectl get nodes 
    NAME                             STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
    js-104-106.jetstream-cloud.org   Ready    master   6h12m   v1.15.1

### Run interactive container

You can do most anything in Kubernetes that you can do in Docker. E.g. run a simple interactive container:

    kubectl run busybox -i --tty --image=busybox --restart=Never --rm -- sh

    / # 
    / # busybox | head -1
    BusyBox v1.31.0 (2019-07-16 01:13:11 UTC) multi-call binary.
    
### Etherpad example

You can put as many Kube objects as you want in a YAML file and "apply" it all as one big chunk.

For example, take a look at mpackard-etherpad.yml.

    vim mpackard-etherpad.yml

If you're on a shared system, change all the "mpackard" to your name. Note there is Deployment and a Service section. The Deployment indicates what container(s) to run, and the Service creates a network route to the containers.

    cat mpackard-etherpad.yml

Deploy it:

    kubectl apply -f mpackard-etherpad.yml

See if it's running:

    kubectl get pod,deployment,service
    NAME                            READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/etherpad-55d84f9ffc-xjdlc   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          14s

    NAME                             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deployment.extensions/etherpad   0/1     1            0           15s

    NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    service/etherpad     NodePort    10.109.117.107   <none>        80:31763/TCP   14s
    service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP        10m

**Note the external port 31763 of the etherpad service.**

Point your browser at your vm and that port number, e.g. http://129.114.104.121:31763

Now take it down:

    kubectl delete -f etherpad.yml 
    deployment.apps "etherpad" deleted
    service "etherpad" deleted

Edit the yml file and change "replicas" to 2, then save and re-apply.

    kubectl apply -f mpackard-etherpad.yml
    kubectl get pods

    NAME                            READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/mpackard-etherpad-5bd7855697-4vgcb   1/1     Running   0          5s
    pod/mpackard-etherpad-5bd7855697-wcfw4   1/1     Running   0          144m

Hit the URL again, create an etherpad, and hit refresh a couple times. What happens? 

Try killing one of the pods:

    kubectl delete pod/mpackard-etherpad-5bd7855697-4vgcb 
    kubectl get pods

...it comes back!


#### Discussion Questions

- Why do you think the etherpad fails 50% of the time?
- What would be the advantage of adding more nodes?

## Storage

Kube has many ways to handle persistent storage for your pods.

- persisten volume claims 
- more traditional file mounting (nfs, etc)

### Volume example

Hopefully you have a working local NFS server from the Ansible step.

    ls /kubedata/nginx
    enterprise.jpg index.html

This is going to get mounted inside our container so that nginx web server can serve it.

Take a look at mpackard-nginx.html. Change the "mpackard" to your username. Note the addition of the Volume and Volumemounts section.

Apply it:

    kubectl apply -f mpackard-nginx.html

Check for running:


    kubectl get pods,deployments,services
    NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/mpackard-nginx-688877c6f9-b99d7      1/1     Running   0          16m
    pod/mpackard-nginx-688877c6f9-ksdp4      1/1     Running   0          16m

    NAME                                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deployment.extensions/mpackard-nginx      2/2     2            2           16m

    NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    service/mpackard-nginx      NodePort    10.97.84.239    <none>        80:31523/TCP     16m

Now point your browser at your IP & port (31523 here). Hit refresh a few times. Even though there are 2 nginx pods, they are serving the same data.


#### Discussion Questions

- What issues would you have with read-write data (e.g. if you were hosting a database)?
- How would you chain some apps together to make a workflow?
- What other features would you like to make this work for your environment?


### Job example

Run a container to completion.

    kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/job.yaml
    
Wait a second... did you just run that without looking at it first? :)

Anyway, check the output:

    kubectl logs job.batch/pi


#### Discussion Questions

- How are Pods and Jobs different?
- What might be another way to run "jobs" using a queueing system like RabbitMQ or Redis?
- Why shouldn't I run random untrusted stuff off the internet? 
- What sorts of things could you accomplish by stringing a bunch of jobs/pods/services together?



## _Fin_


## Kubernetes Reset (destroys all current data)

**Caution, destroys data** 

If you really need to reset Kubernetes and start over with new install:

    kubeadm reset -f
    sudo systemctl stop kubelet
    sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes /var/lib/kubelet /var/lib/etcd

Then re-run the install playbook.
