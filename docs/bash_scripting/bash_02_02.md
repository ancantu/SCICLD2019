### IF/THEN/ELSE
#### Purpose
`IF` statements **test** if a condition is met.
#### Syntax
```
if [test condition]
then ACTIONS
elif [OTHER TESTS]
  OTHER_ACTIONS
else OTHER_ACTIONS
fi

OR

if [test condition]; then ACTIONS ; elif [OTHER TESTS]; OTHER ACTIONS; else OTHER_ACTIONS ; fi
```
```
prompt> a=apple
prompt> if  [[ $a == "pear" ]] ; then echo "MATCH" ; else echo "NO-MATCH"; fi
NO-MATCH
prompt> a=pear
prompt> if  [[ $a == "pear" ]] ; then echo "MATCH" ; else echo "NO-MATCH"; fi
MATCH
```
#### Common test conditions:
##### Strings and Arithmetic

|Operator|Meaning|
|--------|-------|
|String|Comparison|
|=|Equal to|
|==|Equal to|
|!=|Not equal to|
|\<|Less than (ASCII)|
|\>|Greater than (ASCII)|
|-z|String is empty|
|-n|String is not empty|
|||
|Arithmetic|Comparison|
|-eq|Equal to|
|-ne|Not equal to| 	
|-lt|Less than|
|-le|Less than or equal to| 	 	 
|-gt|Greater than|
|-ge|Greater than or equal to|	 	 
|||
|Arithmetic|Comparison	within double parentheses (( ... ))\	 	 	 
|>|Greater than| 	 	 
|>=|Greater than or equal to| 	 	 
|<|Less than|
|<=|Less than or equal to|	 	

##### File tests

|Operator|Tests Whether|Operator|Tests Whether|
|-|-|-|-|
|-e|File exists|-s|File is not zero size|
|-f|File is a regular file|||	 	 
|-d|File is a directory|-r|File has read permission|
|-h|File is a symbolic link|-w|File has write permission|
|-L|File is a symbolic link|-x|File has execute permission|
|-b|File is a block device|||
|-c|File is a character device|-g|sgid flag set|
|-p|File is a pipe|-u|suid flag set\
|-S|File is a socket|-k|"sticky bit" set|
|-t|File is associated with a terminal|||	 	 
|||||
|-N|File modified since it was last read|F1 -nt F2|File F1 is newer than F2|
|-O|You own the file|F1 -ot F2|File F1 is older than F2|
|-G|Group id of file same as yours|F1 -ef F2|Files F1 and F2 are hard links to the same file|

!	"NOT" (reverses sense of above tests)	 	 	 


#### Exercises
Write a script that reads the first two arguments from the command line, a filename and a number. If the file exists and the number is negative, change the permissions on the file to read-only (`r--`). If the file doesn't exist or if the number is greater than 50, then create the file and change it's permissions to `rwx`.

```
vi file_num.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

file=$1
value=$2
negcutoff=0
poscutoff=50

if [ -r $file ]
then
  if [ $value -lt $negcutoff ]
  then
    chmod 400 $file
  elif [ $value -gt $poscutoff ]
   then
     chmod 700 $file
  fi
else
  touch $file
  chmod 700 $file
fi
```
```
prompt> ./file_num.sh fake.txt 70; ls -l fake.txt ;
0 -rwx------  1 beckbw  staff  0 Jul 16 18:59 fake.txt
```
