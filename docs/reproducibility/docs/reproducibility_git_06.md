## Link a Local Repository to GitHub

Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with
other people.  We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to hold those master copies.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the
world.  Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called `my_first_repo`:


![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)](./fig/github-create-repo-01.png)

Name your repository "my_first_repo" and then click "Create Repository":

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)](./fig/github-create-repo-02.png)

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)](./fig/github-create-repo-03.png)

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

```
$ mkdir my_first_repo
$ cd my_first_repo
$ git init
```

If you remember back to the earlier lesson where we added and
committed our earlier work on `notes.txt`, we had a diagram of the local repository
which looked like this:

![The Local Repository with Git Staging Area](./fig/git-staging-area.svg)

Now we have two repositories: the local repository resembles the diagram above, and the repository of the same name hosted on the GitHub servers is completely empty.

Note that our local repository still contains our earlier work on `notes.txt`, but the
remote repository on GitHub doesn't contain any memory of `notes.txt` yet.

The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a "remote" for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to
identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub](./fig/github-find-repo-string.png)

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `my_first_repo` repository, and run
this command:

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/wjallen/my_first_repo.git
```


Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than mine: the only
difference should be your username instead of `wjallen`.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

```
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/wjallen/my_first_repo.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/wjallen/my_first_repo.git (push)
```

The name `origin` is a local nickname for your remote repository. We could use
something else if we wanted to, but `origin` is by far the most common choice.

Once the nickname `origin` is set up, this command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

```
$ git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': wjallen
Password for 'https://wjallen@github.com':

```


### Proxy

If the network you are connected to uses a proxy, there is a chance that your
last command failed with "Could not resolve hostname" as the error message. To
solve this issue, you need to tell Git about the proxy:

```
$ git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
$ git config --global https.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
```

When you connect to another network that doesn't use a proxy, you will need to
tell Git to disable the proxy using:

```
$ git config --global --unset http.proxy
$ git config --global --unset https.proxy
```


### Clone the Repository

Spend a few minutes browsing the web interface for GitHub. Now, anyone can make a full copy of `my_first_repo` including all the commit history by performing:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wjallen/my_first_repo
Cloning into 'my_first_repo'...

```
